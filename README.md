# Building a neural network in Python*
* from scratch, without any ML libraries.

_A 24 hour challenge to build an MNIST 10 digit classifier in Python while avoiding the use of any machine learning libraries_

## Rules. ##

**1. 24 hours to finish.**
**2. No looking at other solutions to this challenge.** 
**3. No using ML Python libraries such as TensorFlow.** (For building the NN.)
**4. Having fun.**

## Initial notes, current state, rough plan. ##

I am doing this project right after completing the DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer course. I know Python quite well and did multivariable calculus last semester. I might miss some software architecture skills. (TODO perhaps?) 

I am currently able to put together some basic models with TensorFlow. I have quite good understanding of the structure of a neural network, and a very rough understanding of backpropagation. 

The project will therefore go this way. I am just guessing, I don't really know: 
1. Outlie the main parts & biggest challenges.
2. Gain more knowledge on the learning part. 
3. Provide solution on data preparation.
4. Prepare the structure of the code for the neural network, think out the learning process meanwhile.
5. ??? Too far in the future. 

## Logs. ##

[21:00] **The start of the challenge.**
[21:27] Finished writing the initial version of this README.

## More detailed comments on the project. ##

**_TODO_** Will fill in once the project is completed, out of the 24 timer.
